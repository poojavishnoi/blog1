          <h1>What is javaScript?</h1>
          <p>
            JavaScript is basically a single threaded programming language.
            JavaScript allows to implement complex features in web
            pages.JavaScript is an Interpreted language which means the code
            runs from top to bottom and the result of the code is immediately
            returned.
          </p>

          <h1>what is a single threaded programming language?</h1>
          <p>
            I.e JavaScript can run only one piece of code at a time. This also
            means that JavaScript has one Call Stack.
          </p>
          <h1>Now what is Call Stack??</h1>
          <p>
            Call Stack is a data structure which records where are we in the
            program. If we invoke a function, we put that on stack. when a
            function returns a value, it gets popped off the top of the stack.
            ## What makes our website slow? When things which are slow are on
            the stack, it slows down the website. This is called Blocking. For
            example, the method such as console.log is not slow, network
            requests, image processing are something which causes blocking.
            Since, JavaScript is a single threaded programming language, this
            means that we have to wait till the request is completed. So till
            then, what does the website do? Basically nothing, it has to wait
            till the request is completed. Here comes *WebAPIs* to rescue.
          </p>
          <h1>What is WebAPI?</h1>
          <p>
            WebAPIs are some features that is not provided by the browser and
            not the JavaScript engine. It includes setTimeout, DOM API, HTTP
            requests and so on.This helps in creating non-blocking, responsive
            behaviour.
          </p>
          <h1>What is an event loop?</h1>
          <p>
            First, we have to understand what happens when a code run. Whenever
            a function is called it first goes in the Call Stack and it stays
            there until it returns something, for ex, if a function returns a
            setTimeout function then it is handled by WebAPI without blocking
            the main thread.The callback function that is in the setTimeout runs
            as long as for the time we passed in the second arguement. Once it
            is completed, It does not goes in back in the Call Stack rather it
            goes in something we call Task Queue. Now comes event loop in
            picture. Event loop check whether the Call Stack is empty, if yes,
            then the callback is added to the Call Stack gets invoked and
            returns a value and get popped off.
          </p>
